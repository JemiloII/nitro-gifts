          What is this site for? Well the site is created by, Shibiko#1337, inorder to combat discord nitro sniping bots.
          I was really frustrated when I was just trying to give out nitros for fun and they were being instantly taken
          by bot. The speeds are so in human, I just knew. So I made this nice site so you all can have a glorious chance
          to win the nitros. All I ask is that if you win a nitro, to at share the news.

          Currently, my nitro gift site is Genshin Impact themed because I'm part of a rather large discord server. If you
          don't like it, well I can only help you by respecting your opinion. However, I'll still think its awesome and I
          am looking for more ways to improve it. All feedback, good and bad are welcomed. I wish you the best in winning
          some nitros~
